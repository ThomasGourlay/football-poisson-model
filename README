In this model, we assume football match results are the outcomes of two independent poisson processes, referring to the home score and away score. We use MLE to fit team ratings to the data to make predictions about the probability of certain match outcomes, namely whether the total goals will exceed 2.5. The specific implementation and justification for how the MLE works, is explained in a pdf which may or may not be found in this repo.

We demonstrate the power of this model by using betting odds data to back-test a simple strategy that estimates the probability of over/under 2.5 goals, and places bets with positive expected value (according to our probability). We can see in the results, that the model was highly successful, profiting in every season and having no obvious long-term drawdowns.

There are many limitations with the model, and it is important to not draw inappropriate conclusions. For one, the model is fitted on the entire dataset, and then used to predict matches in that dataset. This means the model knows all about the future performance of a team, which we do not have in the real world.

I intend to continue this project in the future, perhaps refining hyperparameters and doing more rigorous statistical testing to see whether it has value in a real betting context.
